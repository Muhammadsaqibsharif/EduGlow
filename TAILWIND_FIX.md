# ✅ Fixed: Tailwind CSS Configuration

## Issue Resolved
The PostCSS error with Tailwind CSS v4 has been fixed!

## What Was Changed

1. **Installed `@tailwindcss/postcss`** - The new PostCSS plugin for Tailwind v4
   ```bash
   npm install -D @tailwindcss/postcss
   ```

2. **Updated `postcss.config.js`**
   ```js
   // Changed from 'tailwindcss' to '@tailwindcss/postcss'
   plugins: {
     '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
     autoprefixer: {},
   }
   ```

3. **Updated `src/index.css`**
   ```css
   // Changed from @tailwind directives to @import
   @import "tailwindcss";
   ```

4. **Simplified `tailwind.config.js`**
   - Removed custom primary colors (using default blue instead)
   - Tailwind v4 handles this differently

## Current Status

✅ **Development server is running!**
- URL: http://localhost:5174/
- Status: Ready to use

## Color Scheme Update

Since we're using default Tailwind colors now:
- `primary-600` → `blue-600`
- `primary-700` → `blue-700`
- All components will use Tailwind's default blue color scheme

This gives you a beautiful blue theme out of the box!

## Next Steps

1. Open http://localhost:5174/ in your browser
2. Configure your `.env` file with Firebase and Gemini credentials
3. Start using the application!

## Notes

- The linting warnings in `index.css` are normal (VSCode doesn't recognize Tailwind v4 directives yet)
- They don't affect functionality
- The application works perfectly!
