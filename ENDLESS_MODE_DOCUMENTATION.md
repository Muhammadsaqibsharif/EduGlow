# Endless Quiz Mode Documentation

## Overview
The Endless Quiz Mode is a challenging game mode where players answer questions starting from super easy difficulty and gradually progressing to harder levels. **One wrong answer ends the game**, and players compete on a global leaderboard to see who can answer the most questions correctly.

## Features

### 1. Progressive Difficulty System
- **Easy Level (Questions 1-5)**: Basic concepts, straightforward questions
- **Medium Level (Questions 6-10)**: Requires understanding and application of concepts
- **Hard Level (Questions 11+)**: Complex scenarios, critical thinking, advanced concepts

The difficulty automatically increases as players answer more questions correctly.

### 2. One Strike Rule
- Players must answer every question correctly to continue
- A single wrong answer immediately ends the quiz
- No second chances - keeps the game challenging and competitive

### 3. Global Leaderboard System
- Scores are automatically saved to a global leaderboard
- Leaderboard can be filtered by:
  - All subjects
  - Specific subject
  - Specific topic
- Shows top 50 players globally
- Displays:
  - Player rank (ü•á ü•à ü•â for top 3)
  - Player name
  - Number of correct answers
  - Time taken
  - Final difficulty reached
  - Subject and topic

### 4. Visual Podium Display
- Top 3 players are showcased on a visual podium
- Gold, Silver, and Bronze styling for the champions
- Makes the leaderboard more engaging and competitive

- Hard difficulty (10+ questions) is where champions are made

## Future Enhancements (Ideas)
- Daily/Weekly leaderboard resets
- Achievements and badges
- Multiplayer head-to-head mode
- Streak bonuses for consecutive correct answers
- Custom difficulty curves
- Category-specific leaderboards

## Testing Checklist
- ‚úÖ Questions start at Easy difficulty
- ‚úÖ Difficulty progresses correctly (5 Easy, 5 Medium, then Hard)
- ‚úÖ Game ends on first wrong answer
- ‚úÖ Score saves to Firestore automatically
- ‚úÖ Leaderboard displays correctly
- ‚úÖ Filtering by subject/topic works
- ‚úÖ Player's own score is highlighted
- ‚úÖ Top 3 podium displays correctly
- ‚úÖ Time tracking is accurate
- ‚úÖ Mobile responsiveness
- ‚úÖ Loading states display properly
- ‚úÖ Error handling for failed API calls

## Performance Considerations
- Questions generated one at a time (reduces initial load)
- Leaderboard limited to 50 entries (prevents large queries)
- Firestore indexes required for efficient leaderboard queries
- Real-time updates not implemented (reduces costs)

## Required Firestore Indexes
```
Collection: endlessQuizzes
- correctAnswers (Descending) + timeTaken (Ascending)
- subject (Ascending) + correctAnswers (Descending) + timeTaken (Ascending)
- subject (Ascending) + topic (Ascending) + correctAnswers (Descending) + timeTaken (Ascending)
```

Firebase will prompt to create these indexes automatically on first query.
