## 🗄️ Database Structure

### New Firestore Collection: `endlessQuizzes`

```javascript
{
  userId: string,           // Firebase Auth UID
  userName: string,         // Display name for leaderboard
  userEmail: string,        // User email
  subject: string,          // Quiz subject
  topic: string,            // Specific topic

## 📝 Notes for Future Development

1. **Firestore Indexes:** Will auto-create on first use. Monitor Firebase console for prompts.

2. **Cost Optimization:** 
   - Leaderboard limited to 50 entries
   - No real-time listeners (reduces costs)
   - Questions generated one at a time

3. **Scalability:**
   - Current implementation handles thousands of users
   - Consider pagination if leaderboard grows very large
   - May want to implement caching for popular leaderboards

4. **Performance:**
   - Questions load individually (no upfront bulk generation)
   - Firestore queries optimized with indexes
   - Images/assets could be lazy-loaded if added
